In a world of bits and bytes
Where numbers dance and play,
There lies a field of knowledge
Where data holds its sway.

Data science, the magician
Who pulls insights from the void,
Unveiling hidden patterns
That cannot be ignored.

From spreadsheets and databases
To machine learning’s might,
Data scientists uncover
Truths hidden from plain sight.

They program and they ponder
To unlock the secrets held,
Turning raw data into gold
With algorithms compelled.

They mine for precious nuggets
In the vast sea of information,
Guiding us towards decisions
That shape our future’s creation.

So let us praise the data scientists
For their tireless work and skill,
For they are the modern wizards
Whose magic we fulfill.
